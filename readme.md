# plugdj scripts

Collection of useful plugdj scripts.

## How do I use it?

Visit [this page](https://mikolajkalwa.github.io/plugdj-scripts/) and drag the buttons into bookmarks bar.


You can also manually create a new bookmark for each script with the following code:  
`javascript:(function(){$.getScript('https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/MikolajKalwa/plugdj-scripts/<scriptName>.js')})();`

For example:  
`javascript:(function(){$.getScript('https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/MikolajKalwa/plugdj-scripts/ban.js')})();`

## Purpose of each file?

Those scripts are useful if you know the ID of a user for which you want to perform an action:  
* [ban.js](ban.js)
* [waitlistBan.js](waitlistBan.js)
* [updateStaff.js](updateStaff.js)

[unbanAll.js](unbanAll.js) - plugdj doesn't have an option to unban all users at once. This script does it for you.  
[getChatHistory.js](getChatHistory.js) - this one is the most interesting one. It puts chat history directly to the chat. You must check how awesome is that!
